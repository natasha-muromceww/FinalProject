# FinalProject

For the final project our assignment was to create a data visualization that could be placed on the large touchscreen in the library basement. When brainstorming how to make good use of such a public and interactive screen, I was inspired by JKE's words asking us as an Andover community to do better. I thought about how I could make a visualization that could spread positivity and lift the spirits of the student body. Working with Chenault Ellis and Claire de Saint Phalle, we came up with the idea of a compliment wall. We used Google Docs to build a survey that collected compliments, emails, and data on the compliments and put the recieved data into a Google Spreadsheet. We used StreamLit, Github, and Python to build a StreamLit App that shows a QR code for students to fill out the survey, recent compliments, and visualizations of the data collected. In order to collect data before the project was public, we asked our friends to fill out the survey and the results have been extremely positive.
